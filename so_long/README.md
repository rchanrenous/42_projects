# So\_long 

## Description

So\_long is a graphical project where the goal is to create a 2D video game.

It is a basic game that consists of a character that needs to collect all the objects and get to the exit to end the game.
The program must display the game on the screen and animate it.

An internal graphical library from Ecole 42 is provided to interface with the X server.

Key features include:
- reading and checking input maps to create the gameplay
- handling keyboard and mouse events to play the video game

The project is entirely coded in C language with limited standard library function usage, and uses a Makefile to build the program.

Special care is given to program error management and avoiding memory leaks at all times.

## Requirements

Following packages:
- gcc
- git
- make
- xorg
- libxext-dev
- libbsd-dev
